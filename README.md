SherlockNavigationDrawer
========================

Modification of the Android NavigationDrawer sample to use ActionbarSherlock so that we can use the NavigationDrawer on older devices.

Orignal sample and documentation are here:
http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html

ActionBarSherlock needs to be added as a library project to make this project compile. Tested on Android 2.3.7 and Android 4.2.2.

**DEPRECATED**

Please use the [Design Support Library][support_lib], and in particular, the [NavigationView][]
